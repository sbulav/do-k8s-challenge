      Images from unknown, public registries can be of dubious quality and may not be
      scanned and secured, representing a high degree of risk. Requiring use of known, approved
      registries helps reduce threat exposure by ensuring image pulls only come from them. This
      sample validates that container images only originate from the registry `registry.digitalocean.com`
